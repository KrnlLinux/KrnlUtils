**Note:** This was not made by any KRNL Developer this was made by SimplyDeveloper, too this will have a GUI soon
## How to install
To install execute `cd /tmp && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimpIyDeveIoper/KRNL_Linux/main/Bootstrapper.sh -O Bootstrapper.sh && bash ./Bootstrapper.sh`
Then execute `bash $HOME/KRNL/download.sh`
## How to update
To update KRNL execute `bash $HOME/KRNL/update.sh`
This will install the latest version of the KRNL console and the KRNL.dll
## How to run
If you already installed to execute use `bash $HOME/KRNL/run.sh` or use the command `krnl`
## Troubleshooting
This KRNL version cant have that much errors because it doesnt have a gui but these are the common errors
<summary> If you have any error that is NOT RELATIONED TO THE PROGRAM, you should check k!tags in the official server and if its relationed to grapejuice join to grapejuice's official server, dont mention anything about ME or KRNL in grapejuice's official server</summary>
<summary> If it attaches but it doesnt make anything else, try pressing Insert and if nothing happens again check if you have the autoexec gui</summary>
<summary> Doesnt even attach? You need to probably install .NET Framework 4.7.2 using winetricks, if this does not work talk to SimplyDeveloper</summary>
<summary> If it does not run or something like that DM SimplyDeveloper#2786</summary>
