## Troubleshooting
This KRNL version cant have that much errors because it doesnt have a gui but these are the common errors
<summary> If you have any error that is NOT RELATIONED TO THE PROGRAM, you should check k!tags in the official server and if its relationed to grapejuice join to grapejuice's official server, dont mention anything about ME or KRNL in grapejuice's official server</summary>
<summary> If it attaches but it doesnt make anything else, try pressing Insert and if nothing happens again check if you have the autoexec gui</summary>
<summary> Doesnt even attach? U will need to run linuxBin/CLI with grapejuice's taskmgr, if you do not want to do this then u need to reinstall your wineprefix</summary>
<summary> If it does not run or something like that DM SimplyDeveloper#2786</summary>
