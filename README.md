# Requirements
Python3 

Bash
## How to install
To install execute `cd /tmp && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimpIyDeveIoper/KRNL_Linux/main/Bootstrapper -O Bootstrapper`

Then execute which python3, add the next text to the start of Bootstrapper and you can execute it using ./Bootstrapper

`#!WHICH PYTHON3 OUTPUT HERE, RETARDEDS`


OR

You can just use python3 ./Bootstrapper

Flag to install krnl : --install-krnl

Flag to delete krnl : --delete-krnl

## How to use
To get help execute the bootstrapper with nothing or the --help flag

To use scripts you can add any script you want into autoexec and if you go to your game and press Insert an internal gui will open, to close it use Insert
## How to update
WARNING : THIS WILL ONLY WORK WITH THE OLD BOOTSTRAPPER FOR THE NEW ONE USE --update-krnl FLAG
To update KRNL execute `bash $HOME/KRNL/update.sh`

This will install the latest version of the KRNL console and the KRNL.dll
## Add KRNL to path
If you want to use one command in the new bootstrapper to start KRNL use the next command

`cd /bin && sudo ln -s $HOME/KRNL/krnl krnl`

After executing that to execute krnl use the command "krnl"
## How to run
WARNING : THIS WILL ONLY WORK WITH THE OLD BOOTSTRAPPER, TO RUN WITH THE NEW ONE EXECUTE $HOME/krnl/krnl VIA PUTTING THAT IN THE CONSOLE OR USING ANY FILE EXPLORER
If you already installed to execute use `bash $HOME/KRNL/run.sh` or use the command `krnl`
## Troubleshooting
<summary> If you have any error that is NOT RELATIONED TO THE PROGRAM, you should check k!tags in the official server and if its relationed to grapejuice join to grapejuice's official server, dont mention anything about ME or KRNL in grapejuice's official server</summary>
<summary> If it attaches but it doesnt make anything else, try pressing Insert and if nothing happens again check if you have the autoexec gui</summary>
<summary> Doesnt even attach? You need to probably install .NET Framework 4.7.2 using winetricks, if this does not work talk to SimplyDeveloper or make an issue in the issues page</summary>
<summary> If it does not run or something like that DM SimplyDeveloper#2786 or make an issue in the issues page</summary>

## New Updates and notes
Changed to python and added more flags

Some flags wont work because i did not add them

When i install windows to get visual studio and then delete it im going to make a GUI version and another version without gui, i know i already have a version without gui but its not that good
