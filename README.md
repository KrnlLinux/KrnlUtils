## Troubleshooting
<summary> We dont know about that much errors about this KRNL but we know that </summary>
<summary> If you have any error that is NOT RELATIONED TO THE PROGRAM, you should check k!tags in the official server</summary>
<summary> If it attaches but it doesnt make anything else, try pressing Insert and if nothing happens again check if you have the autoexec gui</summary>
<summary> If it does not run or something like that DM SimplyDeveloper#2786</summary>
