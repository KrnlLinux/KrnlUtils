**Note:** This was not made by any KRNL Developer this was made by SimplyDeveloper, too this will have a GUI soon
# Requirements
Python3
Bash
## How to install
To install execute `cd /tmp && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimpIyDeveIoper/KRNL_Linux/main/Bootstrapper -O Bootstrapper`
Then execute which python3, add the next text to the start of Bootstrapper and you can execute it using ./Bootstrapper
`#!WHICH PYTHON3 OUTPUT HERE, RETARDEDS`
## How to update
WARNING : THIS WILL ONLY WORK WITH THE OLD BOOTSTRAPPER
To update KRNL execute `bash $HOME/KRNL/update.sh`

This will install the latest version of the KRNL console and the KRNL.dll
## How to run
WARNING : THIS WILL ONLY WORK WITH THE OLD BOOTSTRAPPER, TO RUN WITH THE NEW ONE EXECUTE $HOME/krnl/krnl VIA PUTTING THAT IN THE CONSOLE OR USING ANY FILE EXPLORER
If you already installed to execute use `bash $HOME/KRNL/run.sh` or use the command `krnl`
## Troubleshooting
<summary> If you have any error that is NOT RELATIONED TO THE PROGRAM, you should check k!tags in the official server and if its relationed to grapejuice join to grapejuice's official server, dont mention anything about ME or KRNL in grapejuice's official server</summary>
<summary> If it attaches but it doesnt make anything else, try pressing Insert and if nothing happens again check if you have the autoexec gui</summary>
<summary> Doesnt even attach? You need to probably install .NET Framework 4.7.2 using winetricks, if this does not work talk to SimplyDeveloper or make an issue in the issues page</summary>
<summary> If it does not run or something like that DM SimplyDeveloper#2786 or make an issue in the issues page</summary>
